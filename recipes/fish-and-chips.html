    <p class="text">Fish and chips is a hot dish consisting of fried fish in batter, served with chips. 
        The dish originated in England, where these two components had been introduced from 
        separate immigrant cultures; it is not known who combined them</p>    
    <p class="text">Often considered Britain's national dish, fish and chips is a common takeaway food in 
        numerous other countries, particularly English-speaking and Commonwealth nations.</p>
